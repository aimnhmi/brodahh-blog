            <h2>Class</h2>
            <p>As a student, I once had a memorable experience during a scorching hot day at university. As the class began, we immediately noticed something was amiss—the air conditioning was malfunctioning, and the room felt like an oven. Beads of sweat formed on our foreheads, and we tried to fan ourselves with whatever we could find. Despite the discomfort, we tried to focus on the lecture, but the stifling heat made it challenging. The lecturer, seeing our plight, empathized with us and apologized for the inconvenience. He suggested we move to a different classroom with working air conditioning. We all eagerly agreed and filed out of the sweltering classroom, hoping for some relief. However, our excitement soon turned to surprise when we reached the new classroom—it was incredibly small and could hardly accommodate all 50 students. Nonetheless, the lecturer remained optimistic and encouraged us to make the best of the situation. We rearranged the desks and chairs to create some breathing space, and with the help of the small functioning air conditioner, the room gradually started to cool down. Despite the tight quarters, there was an unexpected camaraderie that developed among us. We were all in this together, united by the shared experience of enduring the heat and now making the most of the cramped conditions. Laughter and jokes filled the air, and we found comfort in each other's company. The lecturer continued the lecture with a smile, and we listened attentively, determined not to let the room size dampen our enthusiasm for learning. In this unexpected environment, something special happened—we became more engaged and interactive, forging a stronger connection with the material and each other. As the class came to an end, the lecturer thanked us for our understanding and resilience. He admitted that the circumstances were less than ideal but praised us for making the best of a challenging situation. As we stepped out of that tiny classroom, we were grateful for the experience. It taught us the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and finding joy in the face of adversity. We may have sweated it out during the hot class, but the memories we created and the lessons we learned will remain with us forever, reminding us that even in difficult situations, we can come together and make something positive out of it.</p>
