                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Muhammad Adam Malique. I’m 22 years old. I’m studying business administration at UKM as a first-year bachelor's student. I used to study civil engineering at UTM Johor Bahru until my third-year degree but due to personal issues, I had to suspend it now and will continue after I complete my business admin degree. I currently live in Denai Alam, Shah Alam. I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur. I love everything about football. Dream is free, and my ambition is to work in the football industry. I cared for my body well, maintained a normal BMI, and had a great diet such as 50% protein, 30% fiber, and 20% healthy fats. </p>
                <p>I believe in the quote saying, ‘You are what you eat’. I do weight training three times a week and cardio exercise every day. I love to play football, futsal, and bowling and watch comedy movies in my free time to stay physically and mentally positive. I also practice the piano and how to communicate in Spanish, German and French twice a week. “The more boring you are in real life the less people are interested in you. Sadly, I tell people I have an extraordinarily boring life and it’s incredibly exciting”.</p>
