                <h2>(Aiman) Panorama</h2>
                <p>Sunsets have an enchanting allure, painting the sky with hues of gold, orange, and pink as the day bids farewell. For photography enthusiasts like me, capturing the perfect sunset is a passion that demands patience and dedication. Venturing beyond the typical tourist spots, I embarked on a quest to find rare and secluded places, where the setting sun transforms into a masterpiece. This is the story of my journey in search of the right moment to take a picture at hidden gems rarely visited by the public.</p>

                <p>In our fast-paced and hectic lives, finding moments of tranquility and relaxation is essential for rejuvenating the mind and body. Recently, I decided to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life by visiting a nearby lake. Surrounded by nature's beauty, I found solace and peace, sitting in a comfortable chair and letting the gentle waves and rustling leaves soothe my soul. Here's a glimpse of my serene day at the lake, where I embraced the simple joys of life.</p>

                <p>As a passionate football enthusiast, the opportunity to participate in a FIFA tournament organized by my university filled me with excitement. The competitive spirit in the air was electrifying, and I couldn't wait to showcase my skills on the virtual pitch. Little did I know that this journey would be one of both triumph and heartache. Despite reaching the semi-finals, a heart-wrenching last-minute equalizer led to my ultimate defeat, leaving me with mixed emotions and memories to cherish.</p>

                <p>My first week here falls in the month of Ramadan, which means I have to fast. This is one of the moments when I had breakfast in the room. At that point, various challenges such as classes during the day, having to complete self-registration at colleges and universities and others became a big challenge for my fast.</p>

                <p>On the third of June, My friends and I decided to embrace a new adventure, the colour run event. As I  wore my black jersey, excitement filled the air. With each stride, a burst of vivid hues engulfed me, representing the joy of youth and camaraderie. Amidst the laughter and paint-splashed frenzy, I felt a sense of unity with my fellow runners. As the colour run concluded, my heart brimmed with euphoria, knowing I had not only completed a run but also woven unforgettable memories of togetherness and fun. It was a marathon of a 4km run and I won fifth place. My friends and I had so much fun that day.</p>

                <h2>(Adam) Class</h2>
                <p>As a student, I once had a memorable experience during a scorching hot day at university. As the class began, we immediately noticed something was amiss—the air conditioning was malfunctioning, and the room felt like an oven. Beads of sweat formed on our foreheads, and we tried to fan ourselves with whatever we could find. Despite the discomfort, we tried to focus on the lecture, but the stifling heat made it challenging. The lecturer, seeing our plight, empathized with us and apologized for the inconvenience. He suggested we move to a different classroom with working air conditioning. We all eagerly agreed and filed out of the sweltering classroom, hoping for some relief. However, our excitement soon turned to surprise when we reached the new classroom—it was incredibly small and could hardly accommodate all 50 students. Nonetheless, the lecturer remained optimistic and encouraged us to make the best of the situation. We rearranged the desks and chairs to create some breathing space, and with the help of the small functioning air conditioner, the room gradually started to cool down. Despite the tight quarters, there was an unexpected camaraderie that developed among us. We were all in this together, united by the shared experience of enduring the heat and now making the most of the cramped conditions. Laughter and jokes filled the air, and we found comfort in each other's company. The lecturer continued the lecture with a smile, and we listened attentively, determined not to let the room size dampen our enthusiasm for learning. In this unexpected environment, something special happened—we became more engaged and interactive, forging a stronger connection with the material and each other. As the class came to an end, the lecturer thanked us for our understanding and resilience. He admitted that the circumstances were less than ideal but praised us for making the best of a challenging situation. As we stepped out of that tiny classroom, we were grateful for the experience. It taught us the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and finding joy in the face of adversity. We may have sweated it out during the hot class, but the memories we created and the lessons we learned will remain with us forever, reminding us that even in difficult situations, we can come together and make something positive out of it.</p>

                <h2>(Adam) Tasik</h2>
                <p>On the 9th of June, me and my friends decided to have a little break from doing all the assignments given at the moment and go for a jog for around 2 hours at the lake in UKM. As I started my jog along the lakeside path, I felt an instant release of tension. Each step seemed to carry away the stress that had accumulated over weeks of hard work. The rhythmic pounding of my feet on the soft ground created a soothing melody that synchronized with the gentle lapping of the lake. Nature embraced me in its embrace, and I found myself immersed in its beauty. The shimmering water reflected the changing colors of the sky, creating a mesmerizing panorama. Birds sang melodiously, as if celebrating my liberation from academic shackles. I couldn't help but smile as I ran, feeling an overwhelming sense of joy and freedom. The worries that had consumed my mind during the semester melted away, replaced by a profound appreciation for the present moment. As the sun dipped below the horizon, I reached a small clearing by the water's edge. It was a perfect spot to rest and take in the scenery. Sitting there, I felt a deep connection with nature and with myself. I reflected on the challenges I had overcome during the semester and the growth I had experienced.</p>

                <p>I also had the chance to see the faculty buildings in the campus area during the first week. I also looked for the location of the FEP faculty building and for parking spaces, among other things, in the neighbourhood. I also went inside the faculty building to check out the lecture rooms, classes and other UKM amenities. The pleasant surau and lecture hall intensify the eagerness to learn already present.</p>

                <p>This time, I was brave enough to enter a new location with my classmates by going to the library. But since we were first-year students and lacked a student card at the time, accessing the student card to visit the library was fairly challenging the first time around. We were able to enter and study in the Tun Sri Lanang Library after obtaining permission from the librarian.</p>
